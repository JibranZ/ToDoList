# To-Do List

The To-Do List application is a straightforward tool designed to help users organize and manage their tasks effectively. Featuring a minimalist interface, users can easily add, update, delete individual tasks, and clear their entire task list with simplicity and ease.

Key Features:

Adding Tasks: Users can input new tasks into the application using the provided text input field and submit button. Tasks are dynamically added to a list displayed on the screen.

Updating Tasks: Each task item includes an "Update" button that allows users to modify the task's description. Clicking the "Update" button prompts users to enter a new value for the task, which updates the task item instantly.

Deleting Tasks: Tasks can be removed from the list individually by clicking the "Delete" button associated with each task item. This action triggers a smooth animation effect to visually indicate the task's removal.

Completing Tasks: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkbox next to each task item. Upon checking the checkbox, the task item fades out gracefully using an animation and is automatically removed from the list. This feature provides a streamlined way to manage completed tasks without clutter.

Clearing All Tasks: For convenience, a "Delete All" button is provided at the bottom of the task list. Clicking this button clears all tasks from the list in one go, offering a quick reset option when needed.

Technical Implementation:

Frontend: Developed using HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. CSS animations provide seamless transitions for task deletion and completion effects.

Storage: Utilizes localStorage to store task data locally, allowing users to access and manage tasks across sessions without losing data.
